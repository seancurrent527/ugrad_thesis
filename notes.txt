# Model to map features Fn to Fn+1 %Done
# Look at model features and how it is viewing their importance %Done
# More literature review %Done

# Look at model predictions starting at 2000 - 2017, plotting real data % Uggh - Done
# Look at the submaps in the neural network, seeing if the intial conditions match
# See if my data preprocessing might be causing initial fluctuations % Uggh - It certainly is. Smoothing round 2?
# Try clustering to see how predictions correlate with observed values for specific countries % Done - 3 or 4 clusters prime
# Disect network output using other learning techniques on the simulated output data
# Look at birth and death rates % Done - fits birth rates really well.
# Look at differences between the 44 and 20 feature models % No clear reason to choose 44 over 20. Similar results are achieved with the 20 model.
# PCA on correlation outputs % Meh

# Plot on the world map % Done
# Look at model resets after every 5 years % Done
# Now look at where people go % Will do - next semester or maybe later this semester
# Smooth migrations % Done
# Papers for population modeling % Done
# Look at first layer weights to see which positions it looks at % Done
# Look at features distributions in inputs and outputs to assess variability
# Summary of what works and what doesn't

# LOG SCALE FOR BETTER DISTRIBUTIONS!!!
